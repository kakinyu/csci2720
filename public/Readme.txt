CRUD event data
CRUD user data
Obtain event data from CSV file
Browser history
User interface

HOW-TO
Flush data: get the JSON file from the website. 
First, we get the total number of data in the request. 
Since the number of maximum loaded record is restricted to 100 (dafault 10), 
so we split up the process by (total number of data / 100) to get all data.

Search: retrieve the data from mongodb with search keyword. 
If the serach field is empty, all data will be retrived. 
Otherwise, we will use regex to find all matched keywords in the database.

Password: we use SHA-256 library to hash the password string, 
so that this hashed string will be stored in mongodb. 
In additoin, everytime the user enter the password, 
we convert it to hash string to authorize.

Design Data Schemas and Models
var EventSchema = mongoose.Schema({
	eventId: { type: Number, required: true, unique: true },
	activityName: { type: String, required: true },
	dateTime: { type: String, required: true },
	organizationName: { type: String, required: true },
	locationName: { type: String, required: true },
	departmentName: { type: String, required: true },
	enquiryContact: { type: String, required: true }
});
var Event = mongoose.model('Event', EventSchema);

var UserSchema = mongoose.Schema({
	username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
	password: { type: String, required: true },
	favourite: { type: String, required: true }
});
var User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
